This program has three functions.
1. It can find out if two countries are in the same region.
2. It can find out if two countries are connected directly by border (does not apply to sea border meaning that countries like Japan does not have any bordering countries)
3. It can find out which of the two countries has the highest population

It utilizes a free API from https://restcountries.eu which was shown in class. 

Further ideas would be to get the currency name from the API and use another API to also be able to compare currencies in a country to determin the strongest one. 

The API does not require to type in the whole name of the country, of you omit some parts it will choose the country closest to what was typed. 


Please always end a URL with a '/' to make sure everything will work properly.

Some names can only be accessed by using alternative spellings, which can be found on the website when calling a specific country like https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/norway
